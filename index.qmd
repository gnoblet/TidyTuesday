Dear wanderer, welcome to my #TidyTuesday gallery!

[#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) goes beyond a hashtag! Run by Data Science Learning community, it curates a weekly dataset that everyone can then wrangle and visualize.

You'll find here my mere attempts at contributing to the challenge!

üçÇ Have fun, explore, and reuse (and please cite if needed)!
