## Overview

This week's TidyTuesday explored marriage data of English monarchs, analyzing age differences between kings and their consorts over time. The visualization reveals fascinating patterns in royal marriage dynamics from medieval times to the modern era.

## Dataset

The dataset contains marriage information for English monarchs including:
- King and consort ages at marriage
- Year of marriage
- Names of monarchs and consorts

## Analysis

### Data Preparation

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

# Setup box modules
box::use(
  rdr = readr,
  dyr = dplyr,
  sgr = stringr,
  gg = ggplot2,
  ggt = ggtext,
  gghrbr = hrbrthemes
)
```

```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| message: false

# Get data
df <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-08-20/english_monarchs_marriages_df.csv')

# Convert variables to numeric
df <- dyr$mutate(
  df,
  dyr$across(
    c(king_age, consort_age, year_of_marriage),
    as.numeric
  )
)

# Calculate age difference (positive = king older, negative = consort older)
df <- dyr$mutate(df, age_diff = king_age - consort_age)

# Basic statistics
older_consorts <- dyr$filter(df, age_diff < 0) |> nrow()
total_marriages <- nrow(df)
```

### Key Statistics

```{r}
#| label: statistics

# Get extremes
max_diff <- max(df$age_diff, na.rm = TRUE)
min_diff <- min(df$age_diff, na.rm = TRUE)
max_year <- max(df$year_of_marriage, na.rm = TRUE)
min_year <- min(df$year_of_marriage, na.rm = TRUE)

# Find specific cases
max_case <- df[which.max(df$age_diff), ]
min_case <- df[which.min(df$age_diff), ]

cat("Marriage Analysis Summary:\n")
cat("- Total marriages analyzed:", total_marriages, "\n")
cat("- Marriages where consort was older:", older_consorts, "\n")
cat("- Time period:", min_year, "to", max_year, "\n")
cat("- Largest age gap (king older):", max_diff, "years\n")
cat("- Largest age gap (consort older):", abs(min_diff), "years\n")
```

## Technical Notes

- Used diverging color scale to highlight positive vs negative age differences
- Point size represents magnitude of age difference
- Annotations highlight the most extreme cases
- Data spans from `{r} min_year` to `{r} max_year`
